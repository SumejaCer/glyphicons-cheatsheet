Bootstrap Cheat Sheets
========================

#About Bootstrap 3 Glyphs

Glyphs are great! They're one of my favourite additions to native Bootstrap 3, and are made by the very talented Jan Kovařík over at Glyphicons. I've been working with these glyphs quite a lot, so I thought I'd make a cheat sheet for myself.

#Cheat sheet?

Yeah! To use this cheat sheet, simply find the glyphicon you want to use and click the copy button. This will add the complete HTML code for that glyphicon (span tag and all) to your clipboard, ready to paste into your web development tool of choice.
