##Using this cheat sheet

Go check out the [published Bootstrap 3 Glyphs cheat sheet page](http://jamescroft.github.io/bootstrap-cheatsheets/).

##About Bootstrap 3 Glyphs

Glyphs are great! They're one of my favourite additions to native [Bootstrap 3](getbootstrap.com), and are made by the very talented Jan Kovařík over at [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/). I've been working with these glyphs quite a lot, so I thought I'd make a cheat sheet for myself.

##Cheat sheet?

Yeah! To use this cheat sheet, simply find the glyphicon you want to use and click the copy button. This will add the complete HTML code for that glyphicon (span tag and all) to your clipboard, ready to paste into your web development tool of choice.

##What are Glyphicons exactly?
Glyphicons are basically little symbols, icons, or glyphs (whatever you prefer to call them) that you can use in a webpage, just like a font. If you're creating a site based on Bootstrap 3, you already have access to 200 of them.
